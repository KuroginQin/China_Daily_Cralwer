US urged to treat Chinese goods fairly
China urged the United States on Friday to scrap its "nonmarket economy status" treatment of trade with China, and treat the country's goods fairly, said a government official and an expert. Their comments came after the United States formally informed the World Trade Organization that it opposes granting market economy status to China, a position that, if upheld, would allow Washington to maintain high anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods. The statement of opposition, made public on Thursday, was submitted as a third-party brief in support of the European Union in a dispute with China that could have major repercussions for the trade body's future.
