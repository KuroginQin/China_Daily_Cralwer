Pasta event adds twist to Italian food week
Click, click, click. As I walked into the grand ballroom of an upscale hotel in downtown Beijing, three women at the entrance frantically tapped the counters in their hands. They were tallying up the numbers of guests joining the Guinness World Records challenge for the world's largest pasta-tasting event, which is in fact a charity gala dinner. On the night of Nov 24, more than 300 guests joined the gala in the grand ballroom of the Renaissance Beijing Wangfujing Hotel as eager participants in the culinary challenge.
