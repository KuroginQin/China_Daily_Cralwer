Wayne's wonder strike ushers in Allardyce era
LONDON - Wayne Rooney scored his first hat-trick in six years and a first treble for his beloved Everton as it roared back to life by thrashing West Ham 4-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday. Rooney, who capped his night with a wonder strike that he described as possibly his "best ever" goal, showed no mercy to the man who had handed him his professional debut at Goodison Park back in 2002, giving Hammers boss David Moyes another unhappy return to the ground where he spent 11 years before joining Rooney at Manchester United. Rooney's treble, which was complemented by a late header from Ashley Williams, ensured caretaker boss David Unsworth ended his brief reign with a smile on his face, picking up a second win from seven games.
