Peak performance by Chinese nurse on Scotland's mountains
An Edinburgh nurse is believed to have become the first person from China to conquer all 282 of the highest mountains in Scotland. The mountains, all more than 914 meters, are known as Munros. Sunny He Huang, 45, from Liaoning province in northeast China, started the 70 Munros Challenge two years ago to raise money for the Christian Aid charity. It soon turned out to be something she really enjoyed, firing her determination to climb all 282 peaks.
