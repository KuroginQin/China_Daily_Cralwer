Tradition threatens fish stocks
ISTANBUL - After half a century of fishing, 65-year-old Fuat, a retired Turkish civil servant, is nostalgic for the good old days when the Bosporus in Istanbul teemed with fish. Wearing a black woolly hat, Fuat is one of hundreds of amateur anglers passing their spare time on the Galata Bridge on the European side of Istanbul, trying to fill their buckets. "I've been fishing since I was 15 years old," he said as he cast his line over the waters at the confluence of the Bosporus with the Golden Horn, overlooked by the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque.
