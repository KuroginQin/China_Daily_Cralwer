On the ice, senior hockey players find youth again
After a heavy snow the previous day, the temperature had dropped on Wednesday to as low as-20 C in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province. However, the extreme cold and strong wind on the frozen Songhua River couldn't stop the enthusiasm of a group of ice hockey players. Watching their free and skillful actions on the ice, one would hardly imagine, especially under the heavy uniforms and helmets, that the average age of the 30 team members is 66, with the oldest player being 78. Since the team was founded in 2000, its playing has become a unique scene on the Songhua River. Every year when the river freezes, the 30-plus players meet for their first match. The matches will continue every day without interruption until the following March.
