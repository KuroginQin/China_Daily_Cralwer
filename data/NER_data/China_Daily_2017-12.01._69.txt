Zhang Qianxi wins a top global architectural-photography award. Li Yingxue reports. Zhang Qianxi waited by a swimming pool at Tianjin University on a cold winter afternoon last year. At a certain point when the light reflected perfectly on the water, he clicked the shutter. That photo made Zhang the top winner of the Architectural Photography Awards 2017, which were announced at a gala dinner for the World Architecture Festival in Berlin on Nov 17.
