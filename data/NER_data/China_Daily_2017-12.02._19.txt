Tourism hints at growth
The investment volume in China's tourism market exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($151.5 billion) last year, with turnover totaling 4.69 trillion yuan. However, there was still huge room for further growth as online tourism becomes increasingly popular among consumers and investors, a report said. According to the 2016 China Tourism Investment Report, online tourism contributed 100 billion yuan to the total investment, and the combination of tourism plus the internet will create new opportunities for the market.
