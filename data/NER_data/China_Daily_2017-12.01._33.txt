Party-to-party talks for shared future
Leaders of more than 200 parties and political organizations from over 120 countries are taking part in a high-level dialogue with the Communist Party of China's officials in Beijing from Nov 30 to Dec 3. The record number of parties and organizations will exchange their experiences with the CPC and discuss the latter's concept of building a community of shared future for mankind. The meeting has attracted such attention because China, even with its huge population of more than 1.3 billion, has achieved an economic miracle within a few decades - and peacefully, too. But despite being the world's second-largest economy, China still has to overcome the middle-income trap. And although China is likely to succeed in doing so, by substantially increasing its per capita GDP of over $8,000, it faces some strong economic challenges from not only developed countries but also developing countries with relatively low costs of labor and resources.
