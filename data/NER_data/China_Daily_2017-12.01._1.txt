Beijing says it strictly follows UN resolutions
China has always comprehensively and strictly implemented relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and carried out its due international obligations, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Thursday. Geng Shuang made the remark after Washington asked Beijing to cut off oil supplies to Pyongyang following the latest missile launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Wednesday. He emphasized that China has a firm stance in pushing forward the goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and upholding the international nonproliferation regime, and called for global efforts to this end.
