Gordon conjures up big night as Magic manhandles Thunder
ORLANDO, Florida - Aaron Gordon never got out of control on Wednesday night, and that made all the difference for the Magic. "I think that's what was special about his game - he wasn't out there trying to play superhero," said Orlando coach Frank Vogel. "He played within himself for the most part, and as a result he shot a high percentage."
