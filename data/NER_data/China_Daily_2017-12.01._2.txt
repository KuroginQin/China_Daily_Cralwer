Li, Putin envision linking EEU with Belt, Road Initiative
Premier Li Keqiang said that China is ready to step up efforts to link the China-initiated Belt and Road Initiative with the Eurasian Economic Union when meeting on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The alignment, Li said, can boost bilateral cooperation in traditional and emerging areas to expand cross-border trade and further develop Russia's Far East. The premier arrived in Moscow after a three-hour flight from Budapest, Hungary, where he attended the sixth Meeting of Heads of Government of China-Central and Eastern European Countries and made an official visit.
