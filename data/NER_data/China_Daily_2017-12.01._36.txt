Food trucks offer food for thought
In New York, including glitzy downtown and midtown Manhattan, thousands of food trucks sell delicacies from around the world, from jianbing (Chinese crepe), hot dog, falafel, tacos, sushi and waffles to steaks, burgers, juices and desserts. The tasty and affordable culinary delights they offer draw large crowds of people from the nearby high-rise office buildings. Besides sidewalks, food trucks in New York can also be found at concerts, and they are also hired for wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, anniversaries and reunions.
