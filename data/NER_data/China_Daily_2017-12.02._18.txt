Shanghai-based budget carrier aims to innovate travel payments through its smartphone app
Shen Wenhao is about to pay the final installment of his air ticket that brought him from his home of Qingdao, Shandong province, during the National Day holiday in October. "I looked for an affordable air ticket before the holiday, and discovered that I can pay by installments without down payment on Spring Airlines' app," said the 25-year-old, who works for a logistics company. Like Shen, many people benefit from the new payment service launched by Shanghai-based budget carrier Spring Airlines, which aims to innovate travel consumption through its smartphone app.
