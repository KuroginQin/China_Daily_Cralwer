Tighter credit may add to pressure
The Chinese economy is expected to remain robust next year, while tightened credit and strengthened environmental inspections may pose some downward pressure, economists said. China is expected to see 6.7 percent growth in 2018, following 6.8 percent year-on-year growth this year, according to a forecast by the research institute of Bank of China on Thursday. "Some bright spots appeared in the economy this year, say, improved industrial profits, will lead to a strong beginning in 2018," said Zhou Jingtong, a senior researcher at the institute.
