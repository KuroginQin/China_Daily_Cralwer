Industrial internet to boost smart manufacturing
China's push to develop industrial internet will inject a fresh impetus to the development of smart manufacturing as well as the integration of the industry and the internet, analysts said on Wednesday. "Accelerated steps on industrial internet are of significance to China's advanced manufacturing amid fierce competition from abroad. It will help promote deeper integration of the country's real economy with internet, big data and artificial intelligence," said Yang Chunli, a researcher at the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank. The State Council, China's cabinet, earlier this week unveiled a guideline that aims to build three to five industrial internet platforms, which will reach international standards by 2025 and lead the world in key areas by 2035.
