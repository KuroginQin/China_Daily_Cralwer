Interview that was music to my ears
When people ask me about my most memorable interview of the perhaps thousands I have done at China Daily there is usually little hesitation in my response. Although there are others that stand out, the one I did with the great Russian pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy is the one I most fondly recollect. Even the way it was set up was slightly bizarre. I happened to be listening to one of his trademark performances of Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto while cooking dinner one evening when the phone rang.
