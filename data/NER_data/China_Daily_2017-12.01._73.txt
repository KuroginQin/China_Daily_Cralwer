Intrigue abounds for Kremlin World Cup draw
MOSCOW - Germany will find out who stands between it and a successful defense of the World Cup as the draw for the 2018 finals in Russia is held in a glitzy ceremony at the Kremlin on Friday. After beating Lionel Messi's Argentina in the final in Rio to lift the World Cup in 2014, the aim for Joachim Loew's side is to become the first nation since Brazil in 1962 to retain the trophy. Having already won the Confederations Cup in Russia earlier this year with a patchwork squad, Germany is the leading favorite for glory in 2018 - a status Loew himself has said there is no avoiding.
