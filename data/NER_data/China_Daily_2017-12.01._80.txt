Contrite Conte regrets ref rant
LONDON - Antonio Conte has apologized after the Chelsea manager was sent to the stands for a furious touchline rant during his side's 1-0 win over Swansea. Conte was incensed with what he saw as time-wasting by Swansea in the first half at Stamford Bridge, and his frustration boiled over when referee Neil Swarbrick failed to award Chelsea a clear corner. After giving fourth official Lee Mason a piece of his mind, Swarbrick was informed and immediately sent Conte to the stands.
