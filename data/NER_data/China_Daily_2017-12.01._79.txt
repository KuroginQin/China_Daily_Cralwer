PSG duo deliver double trouble
PARIS - Neymar and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain's deadly double act, again delivered a goal apiece in a sluggish 2-0 victory over Troyes that took it 10 points clear of its Ligue 1 challengers on Wednesday. While its nearest chaser, Lyon, succumbed 2-1 at home to struggling Lille and Monaco fell 1-0 at Nantes after a lastgasp Lucas Lima thunderbolt, PSG marched on without ever hitting top gear. A brilliant Neymar strike in the 73rd minute, his 15th goal in all competitions this term, eased nerves at Parc des Princes before the Brazilian set up Cavani, who had a first-half penalty saved, to score in stoppage time.
