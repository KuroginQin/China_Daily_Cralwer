HK athlete accuses ex-coach of sex abuse
The Hong Kong record-holder in the women's 100-meter hurdles, Lui Lai-yiu, said on Thursday that she had been sexually assaulted by her former coach 10 years ago, when she was 13 years old. In a Facebook post, Lui said the coach offered her what he called a "physio treatment" and took her to his home, saying that the school's track was not a good place. He asked her to take her pants off because it was inconvenient for the treatment and then began to touch her private parts, she said. Public reaction was swift. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor pledged on Thursday that the police will "seriously follow up" on the allegations.
