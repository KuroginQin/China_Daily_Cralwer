Chinese singer releases an album reflecting on the past decade
Wang Xi gave himself the English name Elvis to pay homage to his music idol, Elvis Presley. It was in 2007, and Wang was 22. He had then graduated from Liaoning Art Vocational College with a major in pop vocals. "I want to become a great singer like Elvis Presley," says Wang, who was born in Yingkou, a small coastal city in the northeastern province of Liaoning.
