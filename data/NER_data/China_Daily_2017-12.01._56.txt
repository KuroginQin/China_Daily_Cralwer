French vineyards change name to tap big market in China
The Chinese owner of four vineyards in the French winemaking region of Bordeaux has caused a stir by giving the historic chateaus new names with a distinctly Chinese flavor. Chateau Senilhac, which was once the largest wine producer in the Medoc area of Bordeaux, had been in the Grassin family for eight decades when it was sold to Chinese entrepreneur Chi Tong earlier this year. According to one employee, staff at the chateau were instructed from Hong Kong three months ago to rebrand the chateau under the new name Chateau Antilope Tibetaine, or Chateau Tibetan Antelope in English.
