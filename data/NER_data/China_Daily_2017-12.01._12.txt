New laws to improve preschool safety
China will push for legislation on preschool education to regulate teacher behavior and standardize the operation of such institutions, Vice-Minister of Education Tian Xuejun said on Thursday. "We are conducting research to introduce a preschool law, and have started the procedure to push for the legislation," he said during a news conference in Beijing. He made the remark after a series of abuse scandals in kindergartens across the country that caused great harm to minors' physical and mental health.
