Enhanced ties with Myanmar envisioned
China is ready to embark on discussions with Myanmar about new highlights for bilateral cooperation, such as building the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, to better benefit the people of both countries, President Xi Jinping said. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, outlined the vision while meeting with Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi in Beijing on Friday. Suu Kyi is in China to attend the CPC in Dialogue With World Political Parties High-Level Meeting, which convened shortly after their one-on-one meeting.
