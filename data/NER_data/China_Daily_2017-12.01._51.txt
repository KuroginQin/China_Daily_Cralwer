Disney park in Shanghai will open new area
Shanghai Disneyland will open a new themed area, the seventh at the park, by next summer as it strives to attract more visitors to its latest resort, which broke even in the first year of operation. The newly added Toy Story Land marks the first expansion since the site's grand opening last June, demonstrating the company's confidence in China's growing demand for themed entertainment, Walt Disney Co announced on Thursday. The new area will offer three main attractions, a meet and greet area, a boutique store and a restaurant, all of which feature characters from the long-running Disney Pixar franchise, said Jim Shull, executive creative director overseeing the company's parks and resorts segment.
