Ikea offers refund, fixture for dressers
Ikea announced on Friday that it would continue to offer a full refund for anyone wishing to return a Malm dresser purchased in China, placating concerns that Chinese consumers were being treated differently than their Western counterparts. A recall of 17.3 million dressers was relaunched in North America in November after another child's death was connected to the product, but the dressers are still being sold in the Swedish chain's Chinese stores. Ikea said that customers can return the dressers to the store, or can request that Ikea collect the chest of drawers from their home.
