SPP issues guideline to protect children
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has asked prosecutors nationwide to severely punish those who commit crimes against children in kindergartens. According to a notice released by the SPP on Friday, priority should be given to crimes against children, including sexual abuse, rape, indecency and intentional injury and murder. At least three incidents have been reported in November in which children were assaulted or suspected of being abused.
