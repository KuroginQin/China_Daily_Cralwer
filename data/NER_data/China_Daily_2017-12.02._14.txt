Beijing bans fireworks in central area
Beijing authorities have banned fireworks inside the city due to their effects on air pollution and the casualties caused by fireworks in recent years. According to the regulation, passed on Friday by the standing committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, fireworks are banned within the Fifth Ring Road, and district authorities outside the Fifth Ring Road can set areas where fireworks are banned or restricted. In restricted areas outside the Fifth Ring Road, fireworks are allowed only on the eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, as well as from 7 am to midnight from the second day to the 15th day of the Lunar New Year.
