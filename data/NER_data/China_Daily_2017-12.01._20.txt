China, Russia to join in military exercises
Chinese and Russian military units will participate in a series of joint activities before year's end, and will strengthen cooperation in anti-missile defense, the Ministry of Defense said on Thursday. The two militaries will conduct anti-terrorism drills in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region from Dec 2 to 13, said Senior Colonel Wu Qian, the ministry's spokesman. Several Chinese pilots are in Russia learning to fly the Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jet, Wu said. The Su-35 is Russia's most advanced fighter in use. Four of the planes were purchased by China and delivered last December.
