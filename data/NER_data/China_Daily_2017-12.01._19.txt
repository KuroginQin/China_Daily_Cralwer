Test kits on sale in campus vending machines
Health authorities are stocking food vending machines with HIV testing kits at universities in Beijing to help combat a rise of HIV/AIDS among young people, particularly college students. To date, 11 universities in Haidian district - home to 79 percent of the capital's students - have installed 22 vending machines selling HIV testing kits, and two more are expected to join them by the end of the year. The number of new cases of HIV infection has been rising quickly, with most infections occurring in men who have sex with other men, according to the Haidian District Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
