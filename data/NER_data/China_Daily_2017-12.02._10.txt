Global delegates tour Party school
Around 200 delegates from foreign political parties and organizations made a visit on Friday to the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ahead of a high-level interparty dialogue, according to the International Department of the CPC Central Committee. It is the first time the Party school has held a large-scale communication activity with parties from different countries since 2010, when the school was opened to 120 senior diplomats stationed in China from over 110 countries and regions. The interparty dialogue, which started on Thursday and will continue through Sunday, is China's first multinational diplomatic activity since the Party's 19th National Congress in October. The dialogue includes around 600 delegates from over 300 political parties and organizations from 120 countries.
